## History

Hero was developed by [Brock Ferguson](http://www.brockferguson.com) as founder of Electric Function, Inc. Initially, the main Hero app
was released open source but Hero eCommerce required a paid license. Since Electric Function was acquired in 2012, Hero and its
eCommerce upgrade have been released as free, open source software.
