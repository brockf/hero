LICENSING MECHANISM

This software uses IonCube (http://www.ioncube.com) technology to limit the use of the software to a single IP address
or domain name.  In the unforeseen circumstance that Electric Function, Inc. ceases to exist and its servers are
dysfunctional, your software will continue to function without issue for as long as these are conditions are met.  If
you move the software to a server that does not share this domain or IP address, the software will cease to function
and you will experience a license error until the issue is resolved.

In order to protect the copyright of this software, certain files deemed necessary for the proper function of the
application are encoded with IonCube technology.  This prevents bypassing the licensing mechanism and protects Electric
Function, Inc.'s copyright and intellectual property.  However, unencoded "open source" files in the application are
still copyrighted by Electric Function, Inc. (unless otherwise specified) and are subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this agreement.

for you, but you may not resell, redistribute or transfer the modified or derivative version without prior written
consent from Electric Function, Inc. Components from the Software may not be extracted and used in other programs
